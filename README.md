# codesamples
Compilation of code in various languages (Python, Java, C++, Arduino) 

1) IMU_filter.ino - Arduino code for filtering values that come from the Inertial Measurement Unit before using them as input data

2) Pic.java - Jave code for general image processing and specific code for Culvert Research project. These tools were used for preprocessing and to analyze images.

3) UAV_batterylife_sim.cc - C++ code for simulating the battery life of a UAV as it travels from start to goal under different predetermined wind conditions

4) drone_research_img_analytics.py - Python code for traffic analysis work that takes drone data, passes it to object detector to identify vehicles, tracks them with IDs and uses those IDs to determine lanes, speeds, and other metrics

5) encoder_motor_control.ino - Arduino code to use the encoder in a DC motor for better control 

6) lunar_landing_sim.py - Python code for simulation of low altitude descent of a lunar lander (summer internship work)

7) upsampling_lunar_lander.py - Python code for zooming in and enlarging the FOV of images inputted; specifically integrated with lunar lander project
